# Modeling

We implemented 2 different models to detect the relevant items on construction sites:

* YOLO: object detection model, to detect workers and mixer trucks\
* Unet: image segmentation model, to detect vertical formworks and concrete pumps\

Please find details about each model in their respective folder.

Next to this README.md, you'll also find the JSON file we submitted for the challenge. It contains the items detected by our 2 models, in COCO annotation format.
